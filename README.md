# General Assembly Alumni Portal

### Overview 

This project was built as a conceptual project to design a potential layout that General Assembly (an education company that specializes in technology-based career advancement and skill development) could use for its alumni. Users can create an account, search through the accounts of users in an alumni database, and write posts and replies on a community forum. The portal also has placeholder pages for a job board and job tracker.

### Challenges 
There were 2 key challenges with this project:
1. Project scope: This project, designed to be completed within 2 weeks, quickly grew in size as I focused on finding ways to create a strong, clear user experience. This meant that I chose to focus strictly on the Community components of this project, allowing me to have two complete elements, rather than four partially-complete elements. 
2. Project Architecture: As I continued to add more features to improve the user experience, the application's architecture grew increasingly complex. This also made it harder to map out where functions should be stored to minimize redundancies and increase efficiency. Spending further time scoping out the project and mapping out the architecture will help prevent this in future projects. 

### Future Work
Given the challenges mentioned above, the next steps for this project are to 
1. Create the career center elements
2. Refactor the code, moving around the functions to the most efficient parent file and minimizing redundancies.
